> Simulation of famous machine learning algorithms

Here we present beautiful animated visualizations for some famous machine learning algorithms, built with the `R` package `animation`. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/davpinto/ml-simulations).

## Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

**Gaussian Mixture Model** (GMM) fitted by **Expectation-Maximization** (EM) algorithm with random initialization.

## Gaussian Mixture Density

**Density** estimation using a GMM with 7 components. Model fitting is performed by **Expectation-Maximization** algorithm with randomly assigned initial parameters. Positive definiteness of covariance matrix is achieved replacing the unrestricted maximum likelihood estimator by *Ledoit-Wolf* **shrinkage estimator**.

## Regularized Extreme Learning Machine

Classification **Decision Boundary** of a *Single Layer Feedforward Network* (with 150 randomly assigned hidden neurons) trained by **Extreme Learning Machine** (ELM) algorithm considering ridge regression instead of ordinary least squares estimation. The larger the penalty parameter, the greater the amount of smoothing.

## Image Segmentation with K-Means

Image pixels grouping into k different clusters using the k-means algorithm. A different color is assigned for each cluster. This simulation is based on the following post: [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/r-k-means-clustering-on-an-image/).

## Image Reconstruction with Principal Components Analysis

Image reconstruction using the k first principal components (PCs).
